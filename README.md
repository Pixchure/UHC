# UhcCorePlus (UCP)

It's the same as [UhcCore](https://github.com/Mezy/UhcCore), but better.

Should work for versions 1.8 through 1.16.

## Usage

You install this plugin like any other, pretty much.

## Addons

When developing UhcCorePlus, a primary feature of the plugin was support for addons. 

With the UCP Addon API, you can easily create custom scenarios without having to fork the plugin entirely, something that wasn't possible with UhcCore.

> Due to the license terms of the GPL, addons do not have to be under the GPL as well.
> In case you're worried.
